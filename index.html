    <h1>The Quantification of Gravity</h1>
    <h2>Galileo discovered that all objects fall at the same rate. But in order to do it, he had to reinvent time.</h2>

    <div class="intro-text">
      <p>Galileo became interested in motion somewhat by chance. The son of a musician, he was well-trained at keeping time. According to legend, he was bored in church one day and looked up at an incense lamp swinging from the ceiling of the cathedral at Pisa. Using his pulse to measure the time, he determined that the lamp took the same amount of time to swing from side to side each time.</p>
      <p>His interest piqued, Galileo began to study mathematics, and investigate the motion of bodies and the effects of gravity.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section-text right">
      <p>The laws of motion in vogue at the time were Aristotle's. Among other things, Aristotle wrote that the natural tendency of bodies was to be at rest. All motion (except the motion of the heavens) was <i>caused</i> by something acting upon an object, and once that cause had gone away, things would slow down and stop.</p>
