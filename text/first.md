Galileo became interested in motion somewhat by chance. The son of a musician, he was well-trained at keeping time. According to legend, he was bored in church one day and looked up at an incense lamp swinging from the ceiling of the cathedral at Pisa. Using his pulse to measure the time, he determined that the lamp took the same amount of time to swing from side to side each time.

His interest piqued, Galileo began to study mathematics, and investigate motion and the effects of gravity.

The laws of motion in vogue at the time were Aristotle's. Among other things, Aristotle wrote that things fall towards the center of the Earth, and they fall faster the larger they are.

Galileo thought otherwise, and he came up with several thought experiments that demonstrated why he thought this idea was wrong. But he wanted more than that: he wanted to measure how fast things fell.

Before Galileo, no one had ever measured the _rate_ of gravity before: things fell, and some things fell faster than others. The idea of a "rate of gravity" didn't really exist yet, in part because no one knew how to measure it.

But Galileo had an idea.
