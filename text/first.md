Galileo was a timekeeper. The son of a musician, he learned from an early age to _hear_ time and recognize rhythm and measure. It was his interest in time that lead him to study motion.

According to legend, one day he was bored in church and looked up at an incense burner swinging from the ceiling of the cathedral at Pisa, and he noticed that each swing seemed to take the same amount of time. He used his pulse to measure, and soon confirmed it: a pendulum in motion keeps accurate time.

His interest piqued, Galileo began to study mathematics and investigate motion, and the effects of gravity.

The laws of motion in vogue at the time were those of Aristotle.

Among other things, Aristotle wrote that things fall naturally towards the center of the Earth, and they fall faster the larger and heavier they are.

Galileo reasoned that this couldn't be true. What if, say, you tied a heavy thing to a light thing--would they fall at the speed of the heavy one or the light one? He reasoned that all falling things must accelerate at the same rate.

Before Galileo, no one had ever measured the _rate_ of gravity: things fell, but without cameras or stopwatches or the like, they had no way of measuring _how fast_. The idea of a "rate of gravity" didn't really exist yet, in part because no one knew how to measure it.

But Galileo had an idea.
